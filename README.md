# Face-Recognition

Here, We will implement classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbours and
dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to perform face recognition. We
use the given Illumination dataset (Illumination. Mat) which contains images of
dimensions (40x48) ie. (1920 pixels each). 

Refer Report and the code for further information about the project.
